The bookworld site overall looks pretty good.

The main goal of the site is to attract more online users to buy books or media productions in the bookworld site.

There might be a few things can be improved.

1. As the develop, I want to improve SEO for the bookworld site.
When I type "books online store" in the search in google,  booktopia comes to first,bookworld comes to third. 
If bookworld come to first in the search result, then there will more visitors to the site.

2. As the develop, I want to improve the performance of the site.
When I visit the homepage of the site at home, the first page load speed is 4.73s which should be 
reduced to less than 100ms if it is cached property.

3. As the develop, I want to use some profiling tools to find out the slowest thread of the site,such as newrelic.

4. As the develop, I want to use Google Tag Manager for the GA tracking which is easy to use.

5. As the develop, I want to combined all the javascripts into one single file by utilizing gruntjs.

6. As the develop, I want to use HTML5, bootstrap, angular JS for the front end.

7. As the develop, I want to make the API as fast as possible by Ajax call, the API response time should be cached after the first call.

8. As the site visitor, I want to find the book as cheap as possible and I want to know the same book price in the other store.
